# Overview
PittEvents is a comprehensive event management system designed with a component-based structure to support a wide range of campus event activities. This system will be structured to be both scalable and flexible, allowing it to adapt to future needs or potential feature expansions, such as integrating notifications, social sharing, or analytics for event performance. The PittEvents application is intended to make event management more accessible, enhance campus engagement, and facilitate communication among students, faculty, college administration, student organizations, sponsors/donors, alumni, the local community, and event organizers.

# Purpose

The purpose of PittEvents is to provide a centralized platform for managing, discovering, and attending events within the University of Pittsburgh community. This application serves students, faculty, and event organizers by simplifying event planning, promoting campus activities, and fostering student engagement. By consolidating event information, PittEvents aims to streamline the process of finding relevant events, registering attendance, and managing event-related data, ultimately enhancing the sense of community on campus. 

# Scope

The scope of PittEvents project includes:
Create a responsive and user-friendly UI that will allow the user to easily traverse between multiple pages on multiple platforms (desktop, mobile).
Allow users to save their configurations and easily come back to see what events they have attended and are signed up to attend.
Maintain information about the user to avoid having to re-enter the same information multiple times.
Maintain lists of activities the user interacts with.
Allow an event organizer-type user to create and maintain their events.
Create a database to store, manipulate, and maintain all data relating to different users and different events.
Have a healthy amount of information on the users, to allow an organizer to see what demographic of people is attending their event.
Have a very descriptive overview of the event to ensure the user knows what they are signing up for.
Setup schema mapping to the data pipeline from the database to the modal to the various controllers is clean and efficient.
Have a robust backend with a collection of controllers making sure all data is correctly fed into the views (front-end).
PittEvents is intended to support the university community by providing a user-friendly and secure system that integrates various event management and attendance features in a single application.
